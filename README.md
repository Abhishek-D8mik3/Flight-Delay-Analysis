# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis

This project analyzes U.S. airline flight delay data to uncover key patterns and causes of delays across different time frames and airlines. The goal is to derive actionable insights that could be useful for travelers, airline companies, and regulators.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key aspects of the analysis include:

- **Dataset Overview**: Summary and structure of the dataset
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Handling incomplete or missing data
- **Delay Cause Breakdown**: By carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft
- **Time-Based Patterns**: Trends across years and months
- **Top Airports & Airlines**: Based on delay frequency and types
- **Interactive Visuals**: With Plotly for enhanced insights

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Carrier delays** are the most common type of delay.
- **Late aircraft** issues often lead to cascading delays.
- Seasonal spikes in delays, especially during winter and summer holidays.
- Some airports consistently show higher delay percentages.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data handling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
